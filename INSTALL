CMake 2.8.6 or newer
SDL 1.2.15 or newer & dev files
SDL_image 1.2 & dev files
===============================================================================
This project uses CMake for building, which is a cross platform building tool
Either grab it from your package manager or on the official website: 
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Currently only unix based platforms are supported. 
It should still work on other systems supported by CMake (eg. Win32)

You'll also need the SDL library and it's SDL-image plugin.
On Debian based system, you want libsdl-dev and libsdl-image1.2-dev



===== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS=======================================================
1. cd build/
2. use ./build.sh to generate the Makefile using CMake
3. make
4. The binary will be generated as src/towerdefense

Note that currently it is not possible to install the project on your system,
you have to launch it from the building directory.


===== Q&A =====================================================================
Q: Nothing works!
A: That's not a question.

Q: The game fails to load resources
A: Currently the resources/ directory needs to be in the same directory than
the binary. This will probably be changed later.

Q: It's still not working!
A: As of now, this is considered normal behavior !
